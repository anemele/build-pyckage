# build-pyckage

Build unzip-and-run Python-package for Windows.

## About

For many times, I need to run Python program in a
new computer without installing Python only once.
It is unnecessary to install Python on these computers
so that I want a zip file, which could be unzipped and run
directly.

This project is to solve this problem.
