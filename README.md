# build-pyckage

Build unzip-and-run Python-package
for Windows.

## About

For many times, I need to run Python program in a
new computer without installing Python only once.
It is unnecessary to install Python on these  computers so that I want a zip file,
unzip it and run the program.

The Python official releases include an embedded
one for Windows. All this package does is based on
these releases.
